"""Collector / device health and coverage computation.

`coverage_ratio` is the fraction of the planned run during which logcat was
actually collecting. A run with low coverage or a completely unavailable core
collector must never be reported as "stable".

Verdict semantics (spec 4.3 — three independent layers):

- a *confirmed* failure (java/native crash or ANR that is not marked expected)
  always wins: `verdict=unstable`, regardless of collection health;
- with no confirmed failure, incomplete observation yields `inconclusive`;
- only a clean, fully-observed run yields `stable`.

`collection_health` (degraded/inconclusive) and `verdict_confidence`
(high/partial/none) are preserved independently so CI can distinguish
"confirmed failure under degraded coverage" from "no conclusion".
